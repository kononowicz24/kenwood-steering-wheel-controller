# kenwood-steering-wheel-controller
This is a project to adapt the Audi A8 D2 FL multifunction steering wheel to be able to control a Kenwood car audio from the steering wheel controls. 
The large part of the code bases on https://init6.pomorze.pl/projects/kenwood_ford/ and was adapted to feature pin change interrupts on key presses.
